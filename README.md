## Project Overview

In an era where data has become the most valuable currency, SecureVault Prime provides a secure sanctuary for highly sensitive information.

Unlike traditional cloud-based encryption tools, SecureVault Prime is built entirely on a Client-Side, Zero-Knowledge Architecture. This means:

* No servers
* No databases
* No centralized storage
* Zero risk of server-side data breaches

All encryption, decryption, and authentication processes occur only within the user’s browser memory.

This project was developed by Manoj Aberathna as a specialized security solution for business professionals, bankers, journalists, and privacy-conscious individuals.

## Technical Security Stack

| Component              | Technology                                           |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Core Encryption        | AES-256 – Military-grade symmetric encryption        |
| Authentication Hashing | SHA-256 – Secure master password integrity           |
| Architecture           | Zero-Knowledge & Client-Side                         |
| Security Layer         | Custom Salted Pepper Code (AI-resistant obfuscation) |
| Frontend               | HTML5, CSS3 (Industrial Cyberpunk UI)                |
| Logic                  | Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)                            |

The Pepper Code introduces an additional obfuscation layer that makes the cipher-text resistant to AI-based analysis tools such as ChatGPT or Gemini.

## Full Usage Guide

SecureVault Prime follows a Two-Layer Security Model, ensuring that even if one credential is compromised, the data remains fully protected.

### Phase 1: Initial Vault Configuration

1. System Setup

   * Enter an initial setup message
   * Create a strong Master Password

2. Generate Master Security Key

   * The system generates a unique, high-entropy key

3. Secure Storage

   * Store the Master Security Key offline
   * This key acts as your physical vault door

---

### Phase 2: Authentication

1. Enter your Master Security Key and Master Password

2. The system validates the SHA-256 hash locally

3. Upon successful validation, the private vault workspace is unlocked

---

### Phase 3: Data Encryption and Decryption

#### Encryption

* Input sensitive text
* Set a Message Password unique to the data
* The system generates salted cipher-text
* Copy or download the output as a .txt file

#### Decryption

* Log in to the vault
* Provide the cipher-text and the corresponding Message Password

## Key Features

* No-Log Policy
  With no backend infrastructure, no user activity is logged or stored.

* AI-Resistant Encryption
  The Pepper Code prevents pattern recognition by large language models.

* Inactivity Protection
  Sessions are automatically cleared after five minutes of inactivity.

* Zero Dependencies
  Runs entirely from a single HTML file with no external installations required.

* Offline Capability
  Fully functional without an internet connection once loaded.

---

## Important Disclaimer

SecureVault Prime is engineered for maximum security. As a result:

* There is no password recovery or reset functionality.

* Loss of the Master Password or Master Security Key will result in permanent, cryptographically unrecoverable data loss.

Users are strongly advised to store all credentials securely and responsibly.
